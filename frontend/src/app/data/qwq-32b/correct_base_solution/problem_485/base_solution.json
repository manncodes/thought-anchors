  "solution": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the one point that's not on the boundary of a square. All the other points are on the square's edges. So how do I approach this?\n\nHmm. The square is axis-aligned, so its sides are parallel to the x and y axes. That means the square is defined by its minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. The four sides are x = left, x = right, y = bottom, y = top. The left and right are the min and max x-values of the square, and similarly for the top and bottom in y.\n\nWait, but the square's sides are determined by its boundaries. So all points on the square's edges must have either x equal to the left or right, or y equal to the bottom or top. Except for the corners, which are on two edges.\n\nThe input gives 4n+1 points, where n is at least 2. Wait, but the problem says that all but one are on the square's boundary. So there's exactly one point not on any of the four edges.\n\nSo, the strategy would be to find the square first, then check each point to see if it's on the square's edges. The one that isn't is the answer.\n\nBut how do I find the square?\n\nThe square's left and right x coordinates are the minimum and maximum x of the square's edges. Similarly for y. Wait, but since all but one point are on the square's edges, maybe the square's boundaries can be determined by looking at the min and max x and y of all the points except that one point. But since we don't know which point that is, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the min and max x and y values of all the points except the outlier would form the square. But how do I figure that out?\n\nAlternatively, since the square must have at least n points on each of its four sides. Wait, the problem states that \"It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.\"\n\nAh right, so each side has at least n points. Since there are 4n+1 points, the four sides must have exactly n or n+1 points? Or maybe each has exactly n except one? Not sure, but the key point is that the square's boundaries can be determined by finding the min and max x and y values.\n\nWait, because the square's left is the minimum x, and right is the maximum x. Similarly, bottom is the minimum y, top the maximum y. Because all the points on the square's edges must have x between left and right, and y between bottom and top. But the edges are only on the borders. So the left edge is x = left, right edge is x = right, bottom edge y = bottom, top edge y = top.\n\nSo the square's boundaries are determined by the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the points on the square. But since all but one point are on the square's edges, except for that one point, which might be inside or outside?\n\nWait, the square's edges include all four sides. So the square's edges consist of the four lines. So any point on the edges must have either x equal to the left, x equal to the right, y equal to bottom, or y equal to top.\n\nThus, the left and right boundaries are the min and max x of the square, and similarly for top and bottom. But how do I find those values?\n\nWell, the points that are on the square's edges must have x values either equal to min_x or max_x, or y equal to min_y or max_y. The one point that is not on any of these lines will have x between min and max, and y between min and max (if inside), or perhaps outside? Wait, no. Because the square's edges are the boundaries, the points on the edges must be on those lines. So the square's left and right are min_x and max_x of the square. So the points not on edges must be inside the square? Or maybe outside but not on any edge? Hmm, but the problem says that all but one are on the edges. So the one point is either inside or outside but not lying on any of the four edges.\n\nSo the idea is to find the min and max x and y, but perhaps the square's boundaries are determined by the min and max of all the points except the outlier. But since the outlier is unknown, maybe the min and max of all points except that point would form the square. But how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct square's min and max x and y can be found by looking at the frequencies of the x and y coordinates. Because for each coordinate on the edges, their x or y must be either min_x, max_x, min_y, or max_y of the square.\n\nWait, let's think of the x coordinates. All points except one must lie on either x = left (min_x), x = right (max_x), y = bottom (min_y), or y = top (max_y). So the x coordinates of the points must be either left or right, except for some points which have their y coordinates on the top or bottom. The same applies for y.\n\nSo, perhaps the x coordinates of all points except one must be either the left or right of the square. Except that some points might have their x as left/right but their y is on top/bottom, so they are on a corner.\n\nWait, but the square's min_x is the left, and max_x the right. The same for y.\n\nSo, the square's boundaries are min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y. So the points on the edges must have x equal to min_x or max_x, or y equal to min_y or max_y.\n\nThe point not on any edge will have x strictly between min_x and max_x, and y strictly between min_y and max_y. Or maybe it's outside? But then how would that be possible, since all the edges are the square's boundaries?\n\nWait, if the point is outside the square, like x less than min_x or greater than max_x, then it would lie on the left or right edge if x equals the min or max. But if it's outside but not on those lines, then it's not on any edge. So maybe the outlier can be inside or outside.\n\nHmm, but how do I find the min and max x and y?\n\nSuppose we consider all the points. The true min_x is the left boundary, so most points will have x equal to min_x or max_x. The same applies for the other coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, the min_x could be determined by the majority of x coordinates. Because except for the outlier, all other points must be on edges. So for x coordinates, except the outlier, each point is either left (min_x) or right (max_x). So the x coordinates of all points except one are either min_x or max_x. Wait, but not necessarily. Because points can be on the top or bottom edges, so their x can be anything between min_x and max_x, but their y must be either min_y or max_y.\n\nWait, no. For example, a point on the top edge (y = max_y) can have any x between min_x and max_x. So their x can be any value between the min and max. So the x coordinate of such points could be anywhere. So the min_x is the minimal x among all points except the outlier, but how?\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me think: the square has four edges. Each edge must contain at least n points. So the total points on the edges must be at least 4n. But the input has 4n+1 points, so exactly 4n points are on edges, and one is the outlier. So each edge has exactly n points except for possibly one edge which has n+1?\n\nWait, but the problem says it's guaranteed that each edge has at least n points. So the total points on edges is 4n or more. But since there are 4n+1 points in total, the edges must have exactly 4n points. So each edge has exactly n points except for one edge which has n+1? Or maybe all edges have exactly n, except one has an extra point because of overlapping corners?\n\nWait, the corners are counted in two edges. For example, the top-right corner is part of the top edge and right edge. So a point at a corner is counted towards both edges. Therefore, the total number of points on edges is equal to the sum of points on each edge minus the corners (since each corner is counted twice). Since there are four corners, each edge has its own corner points.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nThe square's boundaries are determined by the min and max x and y. So, the square's left is the minimum x of the square, right is maximum x. Similarly for y. The points on the edges must have either x equal to left or right, or y equal to bottom or top. The outlier point is the one not on any of these lines.\n\nTherefore, the correct min_x is the minimum x-coordinate among all points except the outlier. Similarly, the max_x is the maximum x except the outlier. But since we don't know which is the outlier, perhaps we can find the min_x and max_x as the minimal and maximal x in the entire list, but that might include the outlier?\n\nWait, suppose the outlier has an x-coordinate outside the square's boundaries. For example, if the square's min_x is 0 and max_x is 2, then the outlier could be at x=3. Then the true max_x would be 2, but the maximum x in the list would be 3. That would mess up the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, the outlier could have an x-coordinate between the square's min and max. For instance, if the square's left is 0 and right is 2, the outlier might be at (1, 1), which is inside the square. In this case, the max_x would still be 2, so the min and max are still correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem is that the outlier's coordinates could affect the min/max calculation. So how do we find the correct min and max?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct min_x is the second smallest x-coordinate, and the correct max_x is the second largest, because the outlier could be the smallest or largest. Wait, that might not work in all cases. Let me think of examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nThe points include 0,0 through 2,2. So the min_x is 0, max_x 2. The outlier is (1,1), which is in the center. So the min and max x are still 0 and 2. So that approach works here.\n\nIn the second sample input, the first sample's min_x is 0, but one of the points is (0,3). Since the square's top is y=2, so the top edge is y=2. The point (0,3) would have y=3 which is outside. Wait, the square's top is 2, so the correct max_y is 2. The point (0,3) is outside the square's edges, so it's the outlier. So in this case, the max_y would be 3 if we take all points, but the correct max_y is 2. So here, the max y in the entire list is higher than the correct max. So taking the max would be wrong.\n\nAh! So the problem is that the outlier can have coordinates that are outside the square, which would throw off the min or max.\n\nHmm. So that approach won't work. So how else can I determine the square's boundaries?\n\nAlternative idea: For each coordinate (x or y), the square's boundaries are determined by the two most frequent values, because most points are on the edges. Let me think.\n\nSuppose for x coordinates, the square has left=min_x and right=max_x. So all points except the outlier must have x=min_x or max_x (unless their y is on the top or bottom edge). Wait no, points on top or bottom edges can have any x between min and max. So their x can vary. So the x coordinates of the points can be min_x, max_x, or any between them if they're on top or bottom edges.\n\nBut the left and right edges (x = min_x and x = max_x) must each have at least n points. So the number of points with x=min_x is at least n (since left edge has at least n points). Similarly for x=max_x (right edge). The other edges (top and bottom) contribute points with their y coordinates.\n\nSo the x coordinates of the left edge (min_x) must have at least n points. So perhaps the min_x is the x value that occurs the most in the list?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal x could be the x of the left edge, which has at least n points. So if I count how many points have each x value, the x with the highest count (excluding the outlier) would be either the left or right edge's x. But the outlier might have an x that's unique, but perhaps not.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can count the frequency of each x and y coordinate.\n\nLet me consider the first sample input:\n\nThe x coordinates are:\n\nLooking at all the points:\n\nThe x values are:\n\n0,0,0, 1,1,1, 2,2,2 \u2192 so x=0 occurs 3 times (the left edge has 3 points?), x=1 occurs 3 times (but the left and right edges have n=2, but maybe it's okay?), wait the input is n=2, so each edge must have at least 2 points.\n\nWait the first sample has 9 points. The square has four edges each with at least 2 points. The left edge (x=0) has 3 points (the first three lines), right edge (x=2) has three (the last three?), and top and bottom edges each have their own counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the counts of x's:\n\nFor the first sample:\n\nx counts:\n\n0 \u2192 3 times (points (0,0), (0,1), (0,2))\n\nx=1 \u2192 3 times (the middle column)\n\nx=2 \u2192 3 times (right column)\n\nWait, so in this case, the min and max x are 0 and 2. The left and right edges have 3 points each, which is more than n=2. So the counts for x=0 and x=2 are sufficient.\n\nBut the x=1 has 3 points, but they are part of the top and bottom edges (since they are on the edges in y direction). For example, (1,0) is on the bottom edge, (1,2) on top.\n\nSo, the left and right edges have enough points (3 each, which is more than n=2). So in this case, the x coordinates with the highest frequencies are the min and max, which are the edges.\n\nThe idea is that the left and right edges (the minimal and maximal x) will have at least n points each. So, the x coordinates that have the highest counts (>=n) are candidates for left and right edges.\n\nSimilarly for the y coordinates.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to find the square is:\n\n- Find all possible candidates for min_x and max_x, such that the number of points with x=min_x is at least n, and same for max_x.\n\nWait but how?\n\nAlternatively, collect all the x values and count how many points have each x. The minimal x that has a count >= n is the left edge. Because if the left edge has at least n points, then the x=min_x must have enough points.\n\nWait, the left edge is x = min_x, so all points on the left edge must have x=min_x. So the count of x=min_x should be at least n. Similarly for the right edge (max_x). But the min_x could have more than n points (like in the first example where it's 3).\n\nSo, the left edge's x is the x with the minimal value where the count of points with that x is at least n. Similarly, the right edge's x is the x with maximum value where the count is at least n. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the minimal x is the left edge, so the count of points with x=min_x must be >=n. Otherwise, there's not enough points on the left edge.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each edge has at least n points. So the left edge (x=min_x) has at least n points. So the count of x=min_x must be >=n. Similarly for the right edge.\n\nTherefore, the min_x is the minimal x where the count of x is at least n. Similarly, the max_x is the maximum x where the count is at least n.\n\nWait, but how do I determine which x's are the edges?\n\nAlternatively, the left edge's x is the minimal x in the list (excluding the outlier). Because the left edge must have at least n points. The minimal x would have to be part of the edges. So, perhaps the minimal x in the list is indeed the left edge's x. Because if there is a point with x smaller than that, then that would be part of the left edge, but that would require that there are at least n points with that x. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, the correct min_x is the minimal x of all the points except the outlier, but since we can't know which is the outlier, perhaps the minimal x in the entire list is the correct min_x. But as in the second example:\n\nSecond sample's input has a point (0,3). The square's top edge is y=2, so the max_y is 2. But the points include (0,3), which is part of the outlier. So the max y in the entire list is 3, but the square's max_y is 2. Thus, the max y of the list is incorrect.\n\nSo, in this case, the max y would be 3, but the correct max is 2. So taking the max of all points would give an incorrect value. Hence, that approach won't work.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of trying to compute min and max directly, let's consider that for each coordinate (x or y), the possible candidates for the edges must have counts >=n. Because each edge (left, right, top, bottom) must have at least n points.\n\nSo, for x coordinates:\n\nThe left edge's x value has count >=n (number of points on left edge).\n\nThe right edge's x has count >=n (right edge points).\n\nOther x values (like in between) are part of top or bottom edges, so their counts can be anything, but the total points on each edge must meet the minimum n.\n\nSo, the x coordinates that have counts >=n must be the left and right edges' x values.\n\nSimilarly for y coordinates.\n\nSo, perhaps the left edge's x is the minimal x in the list where the count of x is >=n. Wait, but maybe there are multiple x's with counts >=n?\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample:\n\nThe counts for x are:\n\n0:3, 1:3, 2:3.\n\nSo all have counts >=2 (since n=2). So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so in this case, the minimal x (0) is left edge, and max (2) is the right edge. So even though the middle x (1) has a count of 3 (>=2), it's not an edge's x. So that approach would not work here.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the counts alone are not sufficient to determine which x's are edges. Because in the first example, all x's have counts >=n, but only the min and max are the edges.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is that the left edge is the minimal x in the list (excluding the outlier), and the right is the maximum. So, the problem is to find which x's are the edges.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nThe correct square is determined by the min and max x and y of all points except the outlier. Since the outlier is only one point, the correct min_x would be either the min_x of all points, or the second min. Because the outlier could be the one point that has the minimal x, making the true min_x be the next value. But how do I know which?\n\nAlternatively, iterate over all possible points as the possible outlier, and check whether the remaining points form a square with edges that satisfy the condition (each edge has at least n points). But with 4n+1 points, that would be O( (4n) ) steps, which for n up to 10 is manageable.\n\nWait, 4n+1 can be up to 41 points, so trying each as the outlier would be feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over each point in the list:\n\n- Assume this is the outlier.\n\n- Compute the min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y of the remaining points (excluding this point).\n\n- Check if the remaining points all lie on the edges of the square defined by these min/max.\n\n- Additionally, check that each edge has at least n points.\n\nIf such a scenario is found where all except the current point satisfy the conditions, then this is the correct outlier.\n\nOnce found, output that point.\n\nThat seems plausible. Let's see.\n\nHow to implement this:\n\nFor each point (xi, yi) in the list:\n\n- Create a list of all other points.\n\n- Compute min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y of this list.\n\n- Now, check for each point (except current) whether it is on any of the four edges of the square defined by those min and max.\n\n- Also, check that each edge has at least n points.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, the square edges are x=min_x, x=max_x, y=min_y, y=max_y.\n\nEach edge must have at least n points. So the total points on edges (excluding the current point) must be at least 4n.\n\nWait, but the total points excluding the current is 4n, so exactly they must all be on edges. Because the problem says that all except the one are on edges. So the remaining points must all be on the edges, and each edge has at least n points.\n\nSo for each candidate point:\n\n- Compute the min/max of the other points.\n\n- Check if all those points are on at least one edge (x=min or max, or y=min or max).\n\n- Also check that for each edge, the count is at least n.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then the current candidate is the outlier, so we return it.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\nGiven all points except current:\n\nCompute the min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y.\n\nThen for each point in the remaining points:\n\nCheck if it's on the left edge (x == min_x) or right edge (x == max_x) or bottom (y == min_y) or top (y == max_y). If any of those, then okay. Else, this candidate is invalid.\n\nIf all points pass that check, then proceed to check the counts of each edge.\n\nFor left edge count: count all points with x=min_x \u2192 must be \u2265n.\n\nSimilarly right edge count (x=max_x) \u2265n.\n\nBottom edge count (y=min_y) \u2265n.\n\nTop edge count (y=max_y) \u2265n.\n\nIf all four edges have counts \u2265n, then this candidate is the outlier.\n\nOnce such a candidate is found, return its coordinates.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nNow, coding this approach.\n\nFirst, read all points into a list.\n\nThen, for each point in the list:\n\n- Make a copy of the list excluding this point.\n\n- Compute min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y for this list.\n\n- For all points in this list:\n\n   - check if they are on any edge.\n\n   - if any point is not on any edge, break and try next candidate.\n\n- Then check the counts for each edge.\n\n   - left count: number of points where x == min_x \u2192 >=n?\n\n   - right count: same for max_x \u2192 >=n?\n\n   - bottom count (y == min_y) \u2192 >=n?\n\n   - top count (y == max_y) \u2192 >=n?\n\nIf all four conditions are met, then this is the correct outlier. Return it.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nSample code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 4n+1 points, store as a list of tuples.\n\nLoop over each index i in 0..(4n) (since the list has 4n+1 elements):\n\n   candidate = points[i]\n\n   other_points = points[:i] + points[i+1:]\n\n   # compute min_x, etc.\n\n   xs = [x for x,y in other_points]\n\n   ys = [y for x,y in other_points]\n\n   min_x = min(xs)\n\n   max_x = max(xs)\n\n   min_y = min(ys)\n\n   max_y = max(ys)\n\n   valid = True\n\n   # check all points in other_points are on edges\n\n   for (x,y) in other_points:\n\n       if not (x == min_x or x == max_x or y == min_y or y == max_y):\n\n           valid = False\n\n           break\n\n   if not valid:\n\n       continue\n\n   # Now check edge counts\n\n   left = sum(1 for (x,y) in other_points if x == min_x)\n\n   right = sum(1 for (x,y) in other_points if x == max_x)\n\n   bottom = sum(1 for (x,y) in other_points if y == min_y)\n\n   top = sum(1 for (x,y) in other_points if y == max_y)\n\n   if left >= n and right >=n and bottom >=n and top >=n:\n\n       # Found the outlier\n\n       print(candidate[0], candidate[1])\n\n       exit()\n\nSo this should work.\n\nTesting first sample input:\n\nThe first sample's outlier is (1,1). When we exclude that point, the remaining points all are on the edges.\n\nLet me see: when we process the point (1,1), the other points are all the others. The min_x is 0, max_x 2, min_y 0, max_y 2. Then all points in other_points must be on edges. The (1,0) is on bottom edge (y=0), (1,2) on top edge. (1,1) is excluded, so others are okay. The edge counts:\n\nleft: points with x=0 \u2192 3 (3 points, n=2 \u2192 okay).\n\nright: 3 \u2192 okay.\n\nbottom (y=0): points like (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) \u2192 3 points (but others like (0,0) etc.?)\n\nWait the other_points include all except (1,1). Let me see:\n\nThe points excluding (1,1):\n\nThe first 9 points include (1,1) as the fifth entry. So when we remove it, the other points are the other 8.\n\nWait in first sample, the list would have 9 entries (since n=2 \u2192 4*2+1 =9). The fifth point is (1,1).\n\nOther points:\n\nThe other points include all except that. Let's see their edges:\n\nLeft edge (x=0) has three points (0,0; 0,1;0,2 \u2192 but wait, those are all included except (1,1) is gone. So yes, left edge count is 3 (each of those x=0 points are there).\n\nSimilarly right edge (x=2) has three points (the last three entries except the one not there? Wait, the right points (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are all present except if any are excluded. Since the excluded point is (1,1), they are all present. So right edge count is 3.\n\nBottom edge (y=0) has (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) \u2192 three points. So bottom count is 3 >=2.\n\nTop edge (y=2): (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) \u2192 three points. So yes. So all conditions are met.\n\nThus, when the candidate is (1,1), this will trigger the condition and return.\n\nThe code should work.\n\nTesting second sample:\n\nThe second sample's outlier is (0,3). When we exclude that point, the remaining points form a square with min_x 0 (since the other points have x ranging from 0 to 2?), but let me see.\n\nWait in the second sample's input, the points include (0,3) as the fourth point (assuming order as listed). Let's see:\n\nThe square is supposed to be from x 0-2, y 0-2. So when we exclude (0,3), the min_y would be 0, max_y 2. So the remaining points will have their min and max as required. Then the edge counts would be sufficient.\n\nThe code would check for each candidate. When the candidate is (0,3), the remaining points have min_x 0, max_x 2, min_y 0, max_y 2. Then check each point is on an edge. The (0,3) is excluded, so others are okay.\n\nEdge counts:\n\nLeft edge (x=0):\n\nPoints like (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), etc. The points with x=0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) is excluded. So there are three points (since the input's first four points are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), then (0,3) is the fourth? So excluding (0,3), the x=0 has three points (0,0, 0,1, 0,2). So left edge count is 3 >=2.\n\nRight edge x=2 has points like (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) \u2192 count 3.\n\nBottom edge y=0 has (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) \u2192 count 3.\n\nTop edge y=2 has (0,2), (2,2), and the other points? Let's see. The point (1,2) is present? Looking at the second sample input, the points after (0,3) include 1 0, 1 2, 2 0, etc. So the (1,2) is part of the other points?\n\nYes, the input's lines after the first four are:\n\n1 0 \u2192 yes,\n\n1 2 \u2192 yes,\n\n2 0, 2 1, 2 2.\n\nSo the top edge (y=2) includes (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) \u2192 three points. So counts are okay.\n\nThus, when candidate is (0,3), the conditions are met. So code works.\n\nNow, code-wise, this should handle those cases. The only thing to be careful is that for each point, we have to loop through all other points and check all conditions.\n\nNow, in terms of code, let's see.\n\nRead n, then read 4n+1 points.\n\npoints = []\nfor _ in range(4*n +1):\n    x,y = map(int, input().split())\n    points.append( (x,y) )\n\nThen loop over each i in range(len(points)), which is 4n+1.\n\nWait for each i in range(4*n +1):\n\n   candidate = points[i]\n\n   others = points[:i] + points[i+1:]\n\n   xs = [x for x,y in others]\n\n   ys = [y for x,y in others]\n\n   min_x = min(xs)\n\n   max_x = max(xs)\n\n   min_y = min(ys)\n\n   max_y = max(ys)\n\n   # check all points in others are on edges.\n\n   valid = True\n\n   for (x,y) in others:\n\n       if not (x == min_x or x == max_x or y == min_y or y == max_y):\n\n           valid = False\n\n           break\n\n   if not valid:\n\n       continue\n\n   # Now check edge counts.\n\n   left = sum(1 for (x,y) in others if x == min_x)\n\n   right = sum(1 for (x,y) in others if x == max_x)\n\n   bottom = sum(1 for (x,y) in others if y == min_y)\n\n   top = sum(1 for (x,y) in others if y == max_y)\n\n   if left >=n and right >=n and bottom >=n and top >=n:\n\n       print(candidate[0], candidate[1])\n\n       exit()\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in Python, this should work. The code is straightforward.\n\nEdge cases to think about:\n\n- The outlier is at a corner. Like (min_x, min_y). Then when we exclude it, the edges still have enough points?\n\nSuppose the square has left edge with exactly n points. The corner point is part of left and bottom edges. If that point is the outlier, then the left edge now has n-1 points. But that would violate the condition, so the code would not pick it. Wait but the problem states that the input ensures that each edge has at least n points except when the outlier is removed. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is such that when the outlier is removed, the remaining points have each edge with at least n points. So the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: the third example given:\n\nInput 3: n=2\n\nThe points include:\n\n5 14,\n\n5 17,\n\n25 43,\n\n26 43,\n\n32 41,\n\n33 0,\n\n38 0,\n\n48 17,\n\n48 30.\n\nThe output is 32 41.\n\nSo the square's boundaries are left=min_x, right= max_x, etc.\n\nLooking at the points except the outlier (32,41):\n\nThe other points are:\n\n5,14; 5,17; 25,43; 26,43; 33,0; 38,0;48,17;48,30.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe correct square's boundaries are min_x=5, max_x=48, min_y=0, max_y=43?\n\nWait no, maybe the square is x from 5 to 48, y from 0 to 43.\n\nWait the edges:\n\nLeft edge x=5 has points (5,14), (5,17) \u2192 two points (n=2). That's okay.\n\nRight edge x=48 has (48,17), (48,30) \u2192 two points.\n\nBottom edge y=0 has (33,0), (38,0) \u2192 two points.\n\nTop edge y=43 has (25,43), (26,43) \u2192 two points.\n\nEach edge has exactly n points (2), so okay.\n\nThe outlier is (32,41). Its x is between 5 and 48, y between 0 and43. So it's inside the square, so not on any edge.\n\nSo when we exclude this point, the edges all have exactly n points. So the code would find that.\n\nThus, the code would process each candidate. When the candidate is (32,41), the others' min_x is 5, max_x=48, min_y=0, max_y=43.\n\nAll other points are on edges:\n\nFor example (25,43) is on top edge (y=43).\n\n(26,43) same.\n\n(33,0) on bottom.\n\nYes. The edge counts:\n\nLeft (x=5): 2 points \u2192 okay.\n\nRight (48) has two \u2192 okay.\n\nBottom (y=0): two \u2192 okay.\n\nTop (y=43) two \u2192 okay.\n\nThus, the code would return (32,41).\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n</think>\n\n<solution>\nn = int(input())\npoints = []\nfor _ in range(4 * n + 1):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    points.append((x, y))\n\nfor i in range(len(points)):\n    candidate = points[i]\n    others = points[:i] + points[i+1:]\n    xs = [x for x, y in others]\n    ys = [y for x, y in others]\n    min_x, max_x = min(xs), max(xs)\n    min_y, max_y = min(ys), max(ys)\n    valid = True\n    for (x, y) in others:\n        if not (x == min_x or x == max_x or y == min_y or y == max_y):\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        continue\n    left = sum(1 for (x, y) in others if x == min_x)\n    right = sum(1 for (x, y) in others if x == max_x)\n    bottom = sum(1 for (x, y) in others if y == min_y)\n    top = sum(1 for (x, y) in others if y == max_y)\n    if left >= n and right >= n and bottom >= n and top >= n:\n        print(candidate[0], candidate[1])\n        exit()\n</solution>",

The problem is to find the one point that's not on the boundary of a square. All the other points are on the square's edges. So how do I approach this?\n\nHmm. The square is axis-aligned, so its sides are parallel to the x and y axes. That means the square is defined by its minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. The four sides are x = left, x = right, y = bottom, y = top. The left and right are the min and max x-values of the square, and similarly for the top and bottom in y.\n\nWait, but the square's sides are determined by its boundaries. So all points on the square's edges must have either x equal to the left or right, or y equal to the bottom or top. Except for the corners, which are on two edges.\n\nThe input gives 4n+1 points, where n is at least 2. Wait, but the problem says that all but one are on the square's boundary. So there's exactly one point not on any of the four edges.\n\nSo, the strategy would be to find the square first, then check each point to see if it's on the square's edges. The one that isn't is the answer.\n\nBut how do I find the square?\n\nThe square's left and right x coordinates are the minimum and maximum x of the square's edges. Similarly for y. Wait, but since all but one point are on the square's edges, maybe the square's boundaries can be determined by looking at the min and max x and y of all the points except that one point. But since we don't know which point that is, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the min and max x and y values of all the points except the outlier would form the square. But how do I figure that out?\n\nAlternatively, since the square must have at least n points on each of its four sides. Wait, the problem states that \"It is guaranteed that there are at least n points on each side of the square and all 4n + 1 points are distinct.\"\n\nAh right, so each side has at least n points. Since there are 4n+1 points, the four sides must have exactly n or n+1 points? Or maybe each has exactly n except one? Not sure, but the key point is that the square's boundaries can be determined by finding the min and max x and y values.\n\nWait, because the square's left is the minimum x, and right is the maximum x. Similarly, bottom is the minimum y, top the maximum y. Because all the points on the square's edges must have x between left and right, and y between bottom and top. But the edges are only on the borders. So the left edge is x = left, right edge is x = right, bottom edge y = bottom, top edge y = top.\n\nSo the square's boundaries are determined by the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the points on the square. But since all but one point are on the square's edges, except for that one point, which might be inside or outside?\n\nWait, the square's edges include all four sides. So the square's edges consist of the four lines. So any point on the edges must have either x equal to the left, x equal to the right, y equal to bottom, or y equal to top.\n\nThus, the left and right boundaries are the min and max x of the square, and similarly for top and bottom. But how do I find those values?\n\nWell, the points that are on the square's edges must have x values either equal to min_x or max_x, or y equal to min_y or max_y. The one point that is not on any of these lines will have x between min and max, and y between min and max (if inside), or perhaps outside? Wait, no. Because the square's edges are the boundaries, the points on the edges must be on those lines. So the square's left and right are min_x and max_x of the square. So the points not on edges must be inside the square? Or maybe outside but not on any edge? Hmm, but the problem says that all but one are on the edges. So the one point is either inside or outside but not lying on any of the four edges.\n\nSo the idea is to find the min and max x and y, but perhaps the square's boundaries are determined by the min and max of all the points except the outlier. But since the outlier is unknown, maybe the min and max of all points except that point would form the square. But how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct square's min and max x and y can be found by looking at the frequencies of the x and y coordinates. Because for each coordinate on the edges, their x or y must be either min_x, max_x, min_y, or max_y of the square.\n\nWait, let's think of the x coordinates. All points except one must lie on either x = left (min_x), x = right (max_x), y = bottom (min_y), or y = top (max_y). So the x coordinates of the points must be either left or right, except for some points which have their y coordinates on the top or bottom. The same applies for y.\n\nSo, perhaps the x coordinates of all points except one must be either the left or right of the square. Except that some points might have their x as left/right but their y is on top/bottom, so they are on a corner.\n\nWait, but the square's min_x is the left, and max_x the right. The same for y.\n\nSo, the square's boundaries are min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y. So the points on the edges must have x equal to min_x or max_x, or y equal to min_y or max_y.\n\nThe point not on any edge will have x strictly between min_x and max_x, and y strictly between min_y and max_y. Or maybe it's outside? But then how would that be possible, since all the edges are the square's boundaries?\n\nWait, if the point is outside the square, like x less than min_x or greater than max_x, then it would lie on the left or right edge if x equals the min or max. But if it's outside but not on those lines, then it's not on any edge. So maybe the outlier can be inside or outside.\n\nHmm, but how do I find the min and max x and y?\n\nSuppose we consider all the points. The true min_x is the left boundary, so most points will have x equal to min_x or max_x. The same applies for the other coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, the min_x could be determined by the majority of x coordinates. Because except for the outlier, all other points must be on edges. So for x coordinates, except the outlier, each point is either left (min_x) or right (max_x). So the x coordinates of all points except one are either min_x or max_x. Wait, but not necessarily. Because points can be on the top or bottom edges, so their x can be anything between min_x and max_x, but their y must be either min_y or max_y.\n\nWait, no. For example, a point on the top edge (y = max_y) can have any x between min_x and max_x. So their x can be any value between the min and max. So the x coordinate of such points could be anywhere. So the min_x is the minimal x among all points except the outlier, but how?\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me think: the square has four edges. Each edge must contain at least n points. So the total points on the edges must be at least 4n. But the input has 4n+1 points, so exactly 4n points are on edges, and one is the outlier. So each edge has exactly n points except for possibly one edge which has n+1?\n\nWait, but the problem says it's guaranteed that each edge has at least n points. So the total points on edges is 4n or more. But since there are 4n+1 points in total, the edges must have exactly 4n points. So each edge has exactly n points except for one edge which has n+1? Or maybe all edges have exactly n, except one has an extra point because of overlapping corners?\n\nWait, the corners are counted in two edges. For example, the top-right corner is part of the top edge and right edge. So a point at a corner is counted towards both edges. Therefore, the total number of points on edges is equal to the sum of points on each edge minus the corners (since each corner is counted twice). Since there are four corners, each edge has its own corner points.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nThe square's boundaries are determined by the min and max x and y. So, the square's left is the minimum x of the square, right is maximum x. Similarly for y. The points on the edges must have either x equal to left or right, or y equal to bottom or top. The outlier point is the one not on any of these lines.\n\nTherefore, the correct min_x is the minimum x-coordinate among all points except the outlier. Similarly, the max_x is the maximum x except the outlier. But since we don't know which is the outlier, perhaps we can find the min_x and max_x as the minimal and maximal x in the entire list, but that might include the outlier?\n\nWait, suppose the outlier has an x-coordinate outside the square's boundaries. For example, if the square's min_x is 0 and max_x is 2, then the outlier could be at x=3. Then the true max_x would be 2, but the maximum x in the list would be 3. That would mess up the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, the outlier could have an x-coordinate between the square's min and max. For instance, if the square's left is 0 and right is 2, the outlier might be at (1, 1), which is inside the square. In this case, the max_x would still be 2, so the min and max are still correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem is that the outlier's coordinates could affect the min/max calculation. So how do we find the correct min and max?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct min_x is the second smallest x-coordinate, and the correct max_x is the second largest, because the outlier could be the smallest or largest. Wait, that might not work in all cases. Let me think of examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nThe points include 0,0 through 2,2. So the min_x is 0, max_x 2. The outlier is (1,1), which is in the center. So the min and max x are still 0 and 2. So that approach works here.\n\nIn the second sample input, the first sample's min_x is 0, but one of the points is (0,3). Since the square's top is y=2, so the top edge is y=2. The point (0,3) would have y=3 which is outside. Wait, the square's top is 2, so the correct max_y is 2. The point (0,3) is outside the square's edges, so it's the outlier. So in this case, the max_y would be 3 if we take all points, but the correct max_y is 2. So here, the max y in the entire list is higher than the correct max. So taking the max would be wrong.\n\nAh! So the problem is that the outlier can have coordinates that are outside the square, which would throw off the min or max.\n\nHmm. So that approach won't work. So how else can I determine the square's boundaries?\n\nAlternative idea: For each coordinate (x or y), the square's boundaries are determined by the two most frequent values, because most points are on the edges. Let me think.\n\nSuppose for x coordinates, the square has left=min_x and right=max_x. So all points except the outlier must have x=min_x or max_x (unless their y is on the top or bottom edge). Wait no, points on top or bottom edges can have any x between min and max. So their x can vary. So the x coordinates of the points can be min_x, max_x, or any between them if they're on top or bottom edges.\n\nBut the left and right edges (x = min_x and x = max_x) must each have at least n points. So the number of points with x=min_x is at least n (since left edge has at least n points). Similarly for x=max_x (right edge). The other edges (top and bottom) contribute points with their y coordinates.\n\nSo the x coordinates of the left edge (min_x) must have at least n points. So perhaps the min_x is the x value that occurs the most in the list?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal x could be the x of the left edge, which has at least n points. So if I count how many points have each x value, the x with the highest count (excluding the outlier) would be either the left or right edge's x. But the outlier might have an x that's unique, but perhaps not.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can count the frequency of each x and y coordinate.\n\nLet me consider the first sample input:\n\nThe x coordinates are:\n\nLooking at all the points:\n\nThe x values are:\n\n0,0,0, 1,1,1, 2,2,2 \u2192 so x=0 occurs 3 times (the left edge has 3 points?), x=1 occurs 3 times (but the left and right edges have n=2, but maybe it's okay?), wait the input is n=2, so each edge must have at least 2 points.\n\nWait the first sample has 9 points. The square has four edges each with at least 2 points. The left edge (x=0) has 3 points (the first three lines), right edge (x=2) has three (the last three?), and top and bottom edges each have their own counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the counts of x's:\n\nFor the first sample:\n\nx counts:\n\n0 \u2192 3 times (points (0,0), (0,1), (0,2))\n\nx=1 \u2192 3 times (the middle column)\n\nx=2 \u2192 3 times (right column)\n\nWait, so in this case, the min and max x are 0 and 2. The left and right edges have 3 points each, which is more than n=2. So the counts for x=0 and x=2 are sufficient.\n\nBut the x=1 has 3 points, but they are part of the top and bottom edges (since they are on the edges in y direction). For example, (1,0) is on the bottom edge, (1,2) on top.\n\nSo, the left and right edges have enough points (3 each, which is more than n=2). So in this case, the x coordinates with the highest frequencies are the min and max, which are the edges.\n\nThe idea is that the left and right edges (the minimal and maximal x) will have at least n points each. So, the x coordinates that have the highest counts (>=n) are candidates for left and right edges.\n\nSimilarly for the y coordinates.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to find the square is:\n\n- Find all possible candidates for min_x and max_x, such that the number of points with x=min_x is at least n, and same for max_x.\n\nWait but how?\n\nAlternatively, collect all the x values and count how many points have each x. The minimal x that has a count >= n is the left edge. Because if the left edge has at least n points, then the x=min_x must have enough points.\n\nWait, the left edge is x = min_x, so all points on the left edge must have x=min_x. So the count of x=min_x should be at least n. Similarly for the right edge (max_x). But the min_x could have more than n points (like in the first example where it's 3).\n\nSo, the left edge's x is the x with the minimal value where the count of points with that x is at least n. Similarly, the right edge's x is the x with maximum value where the count is at least n. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the minimal x is the left edge, so the count of points with x=min_x must be >=n. Otherwise, there's not enough points on the left edge.\n\nWait, but the problem states that each edge has at least n points. So the left edge (x=min_x) has at least n points. So the count of x=min_x must be >=n. Similarly for the right edge.\n\nTherefore, the min_x is the minimal x where the count of x is at least n. Similarly, the max_x is the maximum x where the count is at least n.\n\nWait, but how do I determine which x's are the edges?\n\nAlternatively, the left edge's x is the minimal x in the list (excluding the outlier). Because the left edge must have at least n points. The minimal x would have to be part of the edges. So, perhaps the minimal x in the list is indeed the left edge's x. Because if there is a point with x smaller than that, then that would be part of the left edge, but that would require that there are at least n points with that x. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, the correct min_x is the minimal x of all the points except the outlier, but since we can't know which is the outlier, perhaps the minimal x in the entire list is the correct min_x. But as in the second example:\n\nSecond sample's input has a point (0,3). The square's top edge is y=2, so the max_y is 2. But the points include (0,3), which is part of the outlier. So the max y in the entire list is 3, but the square's max_y is 2. Thus, the max y of the list is incorrect.\n\nSo, in this case, the max y would be 3, but the correct max is 2. So taking the max of all points would give an incorrect value. Hence, that approach won't work.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of trying to compute min and max directly, let's consider that for each coordinate (x or y), the possible candidates for the edges must have counts >=n. Because each edge (left, right, top, bottom) must have at least n points.\n\nSo, for x coordinates:\n\nThe left edge's x value has count >=n (number of points on left edge).\n\nThe right edge's x has count >=n (right edge points).\n\nOther x values (like in between) are part of top or bottom edges, so their counts can be anything, but the total points on each edge must meet the minimum n.\n\nSo, the x coordinates that have counts >=n must be the left and right edges' x values.\n\nSimilarly for y coordinates.\n\nSo, perhaps the left edge's x is the minimal x in the list where the count of x is >=n. Wait, but maybe there are multiple x's with counts >=n?\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample:\n\nThe counts for x are:\n\n0:3, 1:3, 2:3.\n\nSo all have counts >=2 (since n=2). So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, so in this case, the minimal x (0) is left edge, and max (2) is the right edge. So even though the middle x (1) has a count of 3 (>=2), it's not an edge's x. So that approach would not work here.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the counts alone are not sufficient to determine which x's are edges. Because in the first example, all x's have counts >=n, but only the min and max are the edges.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is that the left edge is the minimal x in the list (excluding the outlier), and the right is the maximum. So, the problem is to find which x's are the edges.\n\nAlternative Plan:\n\nThe correct square is determined by the min and max x and y of all points except the outlier. Since the outlier is only one point, the correct min_x would be either the min_x of all points, or the second min. Because the outlier could be the one point that has the minimal x, making the true min_x be the next value. But how do I know which?\n\nAlternatively, iterate over all possible points as the possible outlier, and check whether the remaining points form a square with edges that satisfy the condition (each edge has at least n points). But with 4n+1 points, that would be O( (4n) ) steps, which for n up to 10 is manageable.\n\nWait, 4n+1 can be up to 41 points, so trying each as the outlier would be feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over each point in the list:\n\n- Assume this is the outlier.\n\n- Compute the min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y of the remaining points (excluding this point).\n\n- Check if the remaining points all lie on the edges of the square defined by these min/max.\n\n- Additionally, check that each edge has at least n points.\n\nIf such a scenario is found where all except the current point satisfy the conditions, then this is the correct outlier.\n\nOnce found, output that point.\n\nThat seems plausible. Let's see.\n\nHow to implement this:\n\nFor each point (xi, yi) in the list:\n\n- Create a list of all other points.\n\n- Compute min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y of this list.\n\n- Now, check for each point (except current) whether it is on any of the four edges of the square defined by those min and max.\n\n- Also, check that each edge has at least n points.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, the square edges are x=min_x, x=max_x, y=min_y, y=max_y.\n\nEach edge must have at least n points. So the total points on edges (excluding the current point) must be at least 4n.\n\nWait, but the total points excluding the current is 4n, so exactly they must all be on edges. Because the problem says that all except the one are on edges. So the remaining points must all be on the edges, and each edge has at least n points.\n\nSo for each candidate point:\n\n- Compute the min/max of the other points.\n\n- Check if all those points are on at least one edge (x=min or max, or y=min or max).\n\n- Also check that for each edge, the count is at least n.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then the current candidate is the outlier, so we return it.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\nGiven all points except current:\n\nCompute the min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y.\n\nThen for each point in the remaining points:\n\nCheck if it's on the left edge (x == min_x) or right edge (x == max_x) or bottom (y == min_y) or top (y == max_y). If any of those, then okay. Else, this candidate is invalid.\n\nIf all points pass that check, then proceed to check the counts of each edge.\n\nFor left edge count: count all points with x=min_x \u2192 must be \u2265n.\n\nSimilarly right edge count (x=max_x) \u2265n.\n\nBottom edge count (y=min_y) \u2265n.\n\nTop edge count (y=max_y) \u2265n.\n\nIf all four edges have counts \u2265n, then this candidate is the outlier.\n\nOnce such a candidate is found, return its coordinates.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nNow, coding this approach.\n\nFirst, read all points into a list.\n\nThen, for each point in the list:\n\n- Make a copy of the list excluding this point.\n\n- Compute min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y for this list.\n\n- For all points in this list:\n\n   - check if they are on any edge.\n\n   - if any point is not on any edge, break and try next candidate.\n\n- Then check the counts for each edge.\n\n   - left count: number of points where x == min_x \u2192 >=n?\n\n   - right count: same for max_x \u2192 >=n?\n\n   - bottom count (y == min_y) \u2192 >=n?\n\n   - top count (y == max_y) \u2192 >=n?\n\nIf all four conditions are met, then this is the correct outlier. Return it.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nSample code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 4n+1 points, store as a list of tuples.\n\nLoop over each index i in 0..(4n) (since the list has 4n+1 elements):\n\n   candidate = points[i]\n\n   other_points = points[:i] + points[i+1:]\n\n   # compute min_x, etc.\n\n   xs = [x for x,y in other_points]\n\n   ys = [y for x,y in other_points]\n\n   min_x = min(xs)\n\n   max_x = max(xs)\n\n   min_y = min(ys)\n\n   max_y = max(ys)\n\n   valid = True\n\n   # check all points in other_points are on edges\n\n   for (x,y) in other_points:\n\n       if not (x == min_x or x == max_x or y == min_y or y == max_y):\n\n           valid = False\n\n           break\n\n   if not valid:\n\n       continue\n\n   # Now check edge counts\n\n   left = sum(1 for (x,y) in other_points if x == min_x)\n\n   right = sum(1 for (x,y) in other_points if x == max_x)\n\n   bottom = sum(1 for (x,y) in other_points if y == min_y)\n\n   top = sum(1 for (x,y) in other_points if y == max_y)\n\n   if left >= n and right >=n and bottom >=n and top >=n:\n\n       # Found the outlier\n\n       print(candidate[0], candidate[1])\n\n       exit()\n\nSo this should work.\n\nTesting first sample input:\n\nThe first sample's outlier is (1,1). When we exclude that point, the remaining points all are on the edges.\n\nLet me see: when we process the point (1,1), the other points are all the others. The min_x is 0, max_x 2, min_y 0, max_y 2. Then all points in other_points must be on edges. The (1,0) is on bottom edge (y=0), (1,2) on top edge. (1,1) is excluded, so others are okay. The edge counts:\n\nleft: points with x=0 \u2192 3 (3 points, n=2 \u2192 okay).\n\nright: 3 \u2192 okay.\n\nbottom (y=0): points like (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) \u2192 3 points (but others like (0,0) etc.?)\n\nWait the other_points include all except (1,1). Let me see:\n\nThe points excluding (1,1):\n\nThe first 9 points include (1,1) as the fifth entry. So when we remove it, the other points are the other 8.\n\nWait in first sample, the list would have 9 entries (since n=2 \u2192 4*2+1 =9). The fifth point is (1,1).\n\nOther points:\n\nThe other points include all except that. Let's see their edges:\n\nLeft edge (x=0) has three points (0,0; 0,1;0,2 \u2192 but wait, those are all included except (1,1) is gone. So yes, left edge count is 3 (each of those x=0 points are there).\n\nSimilarly right edge (x=2) has three points (the last three entries except the one not there? Wait, the right points (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are all present except if any are excluded. Since the excluded point is (1,1), they are all present. So right edge count is 3.\n\nBottom edge (y=0) has (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) \u2192 three points. So bottom count is 3 >=2.\n\nTop edge (y=2): (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) \u2192 three points. So yes. So all conditions are met.\n\nThus, when the candidate is (1,1), this will trigger the condition and return.\n\nThe code should work.\n\nTesting second sample:\n\nThe second sample's outlier is (0,3). When we exclude that point, the remaining points form a square with min_x 0 (since the other points have x ranging from 0 to 2?), but let me see.\n\nWait in the second sample's input, the points include (0,3) as the fourth point (assuming order as listed). Let's see:\n\nThe square is supposed to be from x 0-2, y 0-2. So when we exclude (0,3), the min_y would be 0, max_y 2. So the remaining points will have their min and max as required. Then the edge counts would be sufficient.\n\nThe code would check for each candidate. When the candidate is (0,3), the remaining points have min_x 0, max_x 2, min_y 0, max_y 2. Then check each point is on an edge. The (0,3) is excluded, so others are okay.\n\nEdge counts:\n\nLeft edge (x=0):\n\nPoints like (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), etc. The points with x=0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) is excluded. So there are three points (since the input's first four points are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), then (0,3) is the fourth? So excluding (0,3), the x=0 has three points (0,0, 0,1, 0,2). So left edge count is 3 >=2.\n\nRight edge x=2 has points like (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) \u2192 count 3.\n\nBottom edge y=0 has (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) \u2192 count 3.\n\nTop edge y=2 has (0,2), (2,2), and the other points? Let's see. The point (1,2) is present? Looking at the second sample input, the points after (0,3) include 1 0, 1 2, 2 0, etc. So the (1,2) is part of the other points?\n\nYes, the input's lines after the first four are:\n\n1 0 \u2192 yes,\n\n1 2 \u2192 yes,\n\n2 0, 2 1, 2 2.\n\nSo the top edge (y=2) includes (0,2), (1,2), (2,2) \u2192 three points. So counts are okay.\n\nThus, when candidate is (0,3), the conditions are met. So code works.\n\nNow, code-wise, this should handle those cases. The only thing to be careful is that for each point, we have to loop through all other points and check all conditions.\n\nNow, in terms of code, let's see.\n\nRead n, then read 4n+1 points.\n\npoints = []\nfor _ in range(4*n +1):\n    x,y = map(int, input().split())\n    points.append( (x,y) )\n\nThen loop over each i in range(len(points)), which is 4n+1.\n\nWait for each i in range(4*n +1):\n\n   candidate = points[i]\n\n   others = points[:i] + points[i+1:]\n\n   xs = [x for x,y in others]\n\n   ys = [y for x,y in others]\n\n   min_x = min(xs)\n\n   max_x = max(xs)\n\n   min_y = min(ys)\n\n   max_y = max(ys)\n\n   # check all points in others are on edges.\n\n   valid = True\n\n   for (x,y) in others:\n\n       if not (x == min_x or x == max_x or y == min_y or y == max_y):\n\n           valid = False\n\n           break\n\n   if not valid:\n\n       continue\n\n   # Now check edge counts.\n\n   left = sum(1 for (x,y) in others if x == min_x)\n\n   right = sum(1 for (x,y) in others if x == max_x)\n\n   bottom = sum(1 for (x,y) in others if y == min_y)\n\n   top = sum(1 for (x,y) in others if y == max_y)\n\n   if left >=n and right >=n and bottom >=n and top >=n:\n\n       print(candidate[0], candidate[1])\n\n       exit()\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in Python, this should work. The code is straightforward.\n\nEdge cases to think about:\n\n- The outlier is at a corner. Like (min_x, min_y). Then when we exclude it, the edges still have enough points?\n\nSuppose the square has left edge with exactly n points. The corner point is part of left and bottom edges. If that point is the outlier, then the left edge now has n-1 points. But that would violate the condition, so the code would not pick it. Wait but the problem states that the input ensures that each edge has at least n points except when the outlier is removed. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is such that when the outlier is removed, the remaining points have each edge with at least n points. So the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: the third example given:\n\nInput 3: n=2\n\nThe points include:\n\n5 14,\n\n5 17,\n\n25 43,\n\n26 43,\n\n32 41,\n\n33 0,\n\n38 0,\n\n48 17,\n\n48 30.\n\nThe output is 32 41.\n\nSo the square's boundaries are left=min_x, right= max_x, etc.\n\nLooking at the points except the outlier (32,41):\n\nThe other points are:\n\n5,14; 5,17; 25,43; 26,43; 33,0; 38,0;48,17;48,30.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe correct square's boundaries are min_x=5, max_x=48, min_y=0, max_y=43?\n\nWait no, maybe the square is x from 5 to 48, y from 0 to 43.\n\nWait the edges:\n\nLeft edge x=5 has points (5,14), (5,17) \u2192 two points (n=2). That's okay.\n\nRight edge x=48 has (48,17), (48,30) \u2192 two points.\n\nBottom edge y=0 has (33,0), (38,0) \u2192 two points.\n\nTop edge y=43 has (25,43), (26,43) \u2192 two points.\n\nEach edge has exactly n points (2), so okay.\n\nThe outlier is (32,41). Its x is between 5 and 48, y between 0 and43. So it's inside the square, so not on any edge.\n\nSo when we exclude this point, the edges all have exactly n points. So the code would find that.\n\nThus, the code would process each candidate. When the candidate is (32,41), the others' min_x is 5, max_x=48, min_y=0, max_y=43.\n\nAll other points are on edges:\n\nFor example (25,43) is on top edge (y=43).\n\n(26,43) same.\n\n(33,0) on bottom.\n\nYes. The edge counts:\n\nLeft (x=5): 2 points \u2192 okay.\n\nRight (48) has two \u2192 okay.\n\nBottom (y=0): two \u2192 okay.\n\nTop (y=43) two \u2192 okay.\n\nThus, the code would return (32,41).\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n</think>\n\n<solution>\nn = int(input())\npoints = []\nfor _ in range(4 * n + 1):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    points.append((x, y))\n\nfor i in range(len(points)):\n    candidate = points[i]\n    others = points[:i] + points[i+1:]\n    xs = [x for x, y in others]\n    ys = [y for x, y in others]\n    min_x, max_x = min(xs), max(xs)\n    min_y, max_y = min(ys), max(ys)\n    valid = True\n    for (x, y) in others:\n        if not (x == min_x or x == max_x or y == min_y or y == max_y):\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        continue\n    left = sum(1 for (x, y) in others if x == min_x)\n    right = sum(1 for (x, y) in others if x == max_x)\n    bottom = sum(1 for (x, y) in others if y == min_y)\n    top = sum(1 for (x, y) in others if y == max_y)\n    if left >= n and right >= n and bottom >= n and top >= n:\n        print(candidate[0], candidate[1])\n        exit()\n</solution>",
